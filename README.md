# Weapon Detection Using Neural Networks in Real-Time Surveillance Video


> A Practical Implementation of the Faster R-CNN Algorithm for Object Detection; detecting guns, knives and non-weapon objects from the webcam video stream:
- Setting up deep learning in Windows OS with TensorFlow. 
- Processing datasets for supervised training.
- Using Google Colaboratory for cloud training. 
- Applied the fundamental mechanism of machine learning for supervised learning

## Background
> This project was created for my final year project. It's about using Faster R-CNN model for detecting guns, knives and non-weapon objects (can be any non-weaponary object) in real-time video stream.
The purpose of this project was not aiming for high accuracy, it was for myself to study the result and effect of non-weapon objects to the accuracy. In addition, this hands-on project helped me to understand the fundamental knowledge on machine learning and computer vision.
